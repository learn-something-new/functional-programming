## Closures

Closures are functions that scope exists within a variable. Any function defined within a closure has access to the scope and variables created
in the parent function. Closures are a part of higher-order functions in languages such as Haskell, as well they are used in languages like JavaScript
for callbacks, allowing the callback to access the variables and scope of the parent function.
