# Functional Programming

In this suite of documents we discuss functional programming: What it looks like, how it works, and what it's good for.  We try to do this from a practical-but-fun perspective, showing examples of functional programming in conventional languages, and (most importantly) how functional programming can complement object-oriented programming.

## [Partial Evaluation](/partial-eval)

Partial evaluation is, in very basic terms, a way to call a function that takes multiple arguments while 
providing a fewer arguments than required. The result will be a new function that now accepts the number of remaining arguments. 

This can be repeatedly done until you have provided all the arguments, and unlike just creating a wrapper as you might in 
non-functional languages, a true functional language will automatically create this function by partially evaluating the function you 
are calling and determining what parameters are provided.
