# Functional Programming

In this suite of documents we discuss functional programming: What it looks like, how it works, and what it's good for.  We try to do this from a practical-but-fun perspective, showing examples of functional programming in conventional languages, and (most importantly) how functional programming can complement object-oriented programming.
