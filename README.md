## [Partial Evaluation](/partial-eval)

Partial evaluation is, in very basic terms, a way to call a function that takes mutiple arguments while providing a fewer arguments than required. The result will be a new function that now accepts the number of remaining arguments. This can be repeatedly done until you have provided all the arguments, and unlike just creating a wrapper as you might in non-functional languages, a true functional language will automatically create this function by partially evaluating the function you are calling and determining what parameters are provided.
